We love to donate our time to help out small and local businesses, or individuals just trying to get their content out. 

But, if you insist on paying, our pricing model is pretty simple. 

We have a fixed hourly rate, and you just pay for the amount of time it takes to build what you want. We'll itemize how much time it took us to build out each feature so you know exactly where your money is going ðŸª™

Our business model is built on trust, not contracts. 

We don't do retainers, require a deposit, or charge you for async communication like email.
