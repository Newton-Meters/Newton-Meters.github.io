If you could use our help, here's the next few steps...

## 1. Let us know how we can help! ✉️
Shoot us an email at [query@newtonmeters.com](mailto:query@newtonmeters.com) briefly describing what information you want on a website

## 2. Schedule a Discovery Session 🔎
We'll email you back and offer to meet for a discovery session. Discovery sessions help us figure out if we're a good fit. We'll discuss things like  
* Who's your intended audience? 
* How do you want them to use the site? 
* How do you want to use the site? 
* Are there any important dates that impact this work? 
* Do you have any existing branding you'll need to match? 

## 3. Check In on Development Progress 💪
We'll maintain a taskboard you can check in on whenever. Usually the taskboard lists work in the backlog, work in progress, and work done. 

## 4. Review and Iterate ♻️
We'll set up regular check-points to review what's been built. We'll ask for your feedback on what needs to change. And, you'll help us prioritize those tasks so we're always working on the things you think are the most important for your site. 

## (Optional) Transfer Code Ownership 👩‍💻
If you are interested in maintaining your own website, and are excited to learn a little web development, we'll set you up with a way to access and edit your code. We can even set up some coaching sessions, so you know where to look when you want to modify your site.
