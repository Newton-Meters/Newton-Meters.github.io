If you could use our help, here's the next few steps...

### 1. Let us know how we can help! 
Shoot us an email ✉️ at [query@newtonmeters.com](mailto:query@newtonmeters.com) briefly describing what information you want on a website.

### 2. Schedule a Discovery Session
We'll email you back and offer to meet for a 🔎 discovery session . Discovery sessions help us figure out if we're a good fit. 

### 3. Check In on Development Progress 
We'll maintain a taskboard you can check in on whenever. Usually the taskboard lists work in the backlog, work in progress, and work done. 💪

### 4. Review and Iterate 
We'll set up regular check-points to review ♻️ what's been built. We'll ask for your feedback on what needs to change.
