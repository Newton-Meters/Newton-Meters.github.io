If you need a website ðŸš€ and you could use a solution where you don't have to pay a monthly hosting fee ðŸ’° feel free to get in touch!

Things we can do with a static website: 
* Host it for free
* Publish static content - blogs, portfolios, documentation 
* Create contact forms
* Embed other apps - calendars, maps, files
* Share materials - pictures, pdfs, Microsoft Documents

We probably wouldn't be a good fit if you needed:
* Authentication
* Integrations with sales apps (Shopify)
* Persist state or workflows that require state (Database)
* An easy way for someone with no development experience to edit your website
