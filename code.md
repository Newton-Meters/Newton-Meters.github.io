One of the trade-offs of being able to host your site for free is that we don't use a website builder. 

We write code. 

Which is faster for us and gives us more control over your design, but you'll need a developer to make changes. 

If you will need a non-developer to maintain your website, you might prefer using popular website builders like 
* Wordpress
* Godaddy
* Squarespace
* Shopify
